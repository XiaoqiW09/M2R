# M2R

This repository contains the notebooks used in the report "How Can the Signature be Used in Machine Learning of Electroencephalography Time Series Data"
for the M2R project for group 15.
Original tests are stored in the "testing" folder, while the main directory contains our code for the models used to obtain the results in the paper.
